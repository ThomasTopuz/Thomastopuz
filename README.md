### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a software engineer with a passion for designing and building solid web applications and distributed systems, I am dedicated to delivering high-quality software solutions that meet business objectives. 

I have a strong interest in software architecture and everything around distributed and large-scale systems and I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the industry by reading big tech engineering blogs.

With a strong focus on collaboration and teamwork, I am always eager to work with others to develop innovative solutions that solve complex problems.
