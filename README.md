### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an Enthusiastic Software Engineer currently employeed at SwissPost as an apprendice (3/4 years). 

My bread and butter is building solid web applications, working on the entire stack, front to back...

During my software engineering journey I had the opportunity to work on several projects, both state of the art, enterprise, production grade projects at SwissPost, but also smaller school and side projects.

On school and side projects I had the natural trend to take leadership and work on the entire software development lifecycle, from functionality analysis to architecting and engineering software solutions, helping other team members.
